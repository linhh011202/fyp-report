This project focuses on the design and implementation of the \textbf{Gateway Dashboard}, a comprehensive management interface for the Speech Gateway API, alongside critical backend enhancements to support secure authentication and monetization.

On the \textbf{frontend}, a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) was developed using \textbf{Vue.js} and \textbf{Vuetify}, featuring a modular architecture that ensures scalability and maintainability. Key implemented features include a secure authentication system supporting \textbf{Email/Password}, \textbf{Google OAuth 2.0}, and \textbf{Apple Sign-In}, enhancing user accessibility and security.

The \textbf{backend}, built with \textbf{NestJS}, was significantly upgraded to include a \textbf{Token Management Module} ensuring session security through token blacklisting and automatic expiration handling using Redis and MongoDB TTL indexes. 

Furthermore, a \textbf{Subscription and Payment Module} was integrated using \textbf{Stripe}, enabling automated recurring billing, plan management, and real-time subscription status tracking. Storage solutions utilizing \textbf{MongoDB} for persistent data and \textbf{Redis} for caching were implemented to optimize performance.

The result is a \textbf{production-ready dashboard} that facilitates seamless user onboarding, secure identity management, and a flexible subscription model, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the commercialization of the Speech Gateway services.
