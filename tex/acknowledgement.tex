I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my mentors \textbf{Kyaw Zin Tun}, \textbf{Vu Thi Ly}, \textbf{Surana Tanmay} and my supervisor, \textbf{Chng Eng Siong}, for their invaluable guidance, continuous encouragement, and expert advice throughout the course of this Final Year Project. Their insights were instrumental in shaping the direction and reliability of this system.

I extend my sincere thanks to the \textbf{Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab} team for providing the necessary resources and technical environment to develop this project. The opportunity to work with real-world technologies like NestJS, Vue.js, and cloud infrastructure has been an immensely rewarding learning experience.

I am also grateful to my friends and family for their unwavering support and patience during the intense periods of development and debugging. Their belief in my abilities kept me motivated to overcome the technical challenges encountered along the way.

Finally, I would like to thank \textbf{Nanyang Technological University} for providing the academic foundation that made this work possible.
