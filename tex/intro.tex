\section{Background}
In the rapidly evolving landscape of speech processing technologies, the \textbf{Speech Gateway API} serves as a critical infrastructure for delivering advanced speech services to various applications. As the demand for these services grows, the need for a robust, centralized management system becomes paramount. Traditionally, interacting with such APIs required direct integration and manual management, which can be inefficient for end-users and administrators alike.

The \textbf{Gateway Dashboard} project was initiated to bridge this gap, providing a user-friendly graphical interface that empowers users to manage their speech processing tasks while giving administrators the tools needed to oversee system operations, manage users, and monetize services effectively.

\section{Problem Statement}
Prior to this project, the Speech Gateway ecosystem faced several challenges:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lack of User Interface:} Users had to rely on raw API calls or command-line tools to interact with speech services, which posed a high barrier to entry.
    \item \textbf{Limited Access Control:} The existing system lacked a flexible authentication mechanism, supporting only basic credentials without modern Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Monetization Infrastructure:} There was no automated system to handle subscriptions, billing, or tiered access plans, hindering the commercial viability of the services.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Administration:} Managing user accounts, permissions, and service plans required manual database interventions, which is not scalable.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive \textbf{Gateway Dashboard} and enhance the backend infrastructure to support commercial-grade features. Specific objectives include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Develop a web-based dashboard} using Vue.js and Vuetify to provide an intuitive interface for users to access speech services and manage their data.
    \item \textbf{Implement a secure authentication system} supporting standard Email/Password login as well as OAuth 2.0 providers (Google) and Apple Sign-In for seamless user onboarding.
    \item \textbf{Design a subscription and payment module} integrating Stripe to handle recurring billing, automated invoicing, and subscription lifecycle management.
    \item \textbf{Create an administrative portal} for managing pricing plans, monitoring system usage, and overseeing user accounts with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    \item \textbf{Enhance system security} through a robust token management system, including token blacklisting and session control using Redis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Scope}
The project scope encompasses both frontend and backend development:

\subsection{Frontend Development}
The frontend is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using the \textbf{Vue.js 2} framework with \textbf{Vuetify} for UI components. Key deliverables include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Public pages for Authentication (Sign In, Sign Up, OAuth handling).
    \item User Dashboard for subscription management and service usage.
    \item Admin Dashboard for plans management (JSON editor with validation) and system monitoring.
    \item Navigation guards and interceptors for secure routing and API communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Backend Development}
The backend enhancements are implemented within the existing \textbf{NestJS} API Gateway. The scope includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auth Module:} Implementation of Google/Apple SSO strategies, JWT handling, and token security features (revocation, blacklisting).
    \item \textbf{Payment Module:} Integration with Stripe API for checkout sessions, webhooks, and subscription synchronization.
    \item \textbf{Plans Module:} A versioned, database-driven system for managing service plans with Redis caching for performance.
    \item \textbf{Subscription Module:} Logic for quota tracking (batch/live durations) and access control based on subscription status.
\end{itemize}
