\section{Background}
In the rapidly evolving landscape of speech processing technologies, the \textbf{Speech Gateway API} serves as a critical infrastructure for delivering advanced speech services to various applications. \textbf{Speech Gateway} is a backend service that provides Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities to end users through a secured API. It acts as a \textbf{middle layer} between client applications and an underlying Speech Engine. Instead of allowing clients to call the speech engine directly, Speech Gateway centralizes authentication, access control, token issuance, and (in this project) subscription/payment management.

As the demand for these services grows, the need for a robust, centralized management system becomes paramount. Traditionally, interacting with such APIs required direct integration and manual management, which can be inefficient for end-users and administrators alike. The \textbf{Gateway Dashboard} project was initiated to bridge this gap, providing a user-friendly graphical interface that empowers users to manage their speech processing tasks while giving administrators the tools needed to oversee system operations, manage users, and monetize services effectively.

\section{Problem Statement}
Prior to this project, the Speech Gateway ecosystem faced several challenges:
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Limited Access Control:} The existing system lacked a flexible authentication mechanism, supporting only basic credentials without modern Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Absence of Monetization Infrastructure:} There was no automated system to handle subscriptions, billing, or tiered access plans, hindering the commercial viability of the services.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Objectives}
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive \textbf{Gateway Dashboard} and enhance the backend infrastructure to support commercial-grade features. Specific objectives include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSO Integration:} Implement secure Single Sign-On (Google, Apple) to streamline user authentication, reduce credential fatigue, and centralize identity management across services.
   
    \item \textbf{Payment Portal:
    }Design a subscription and payment module integrating Stripe to handle recurring billing, automated invoicing, and subscription lifecycle management.
    
    \item \textbf{Frontend Development:} Develop a web-based dashboard using Vue.js and Vuetify to provide an intuitive interface for users to access speech services and manage their data.

\end{itemize}

\section{Project Scope}
The project scope encompasses three major components: Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication, Payment \& Subscription Management with Stripe Integration, and Frontend Dashboard Development.

\subsection{Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication}
This component enables users to authenticate using their existing social accounts or traditional credentials.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Google SSO:} OAuth 2.0 integration with state management for CSRF protection.
    \item \textbf{Apple SSO:} Apple Sign In integration with token verification and privacy-preserving email relay.
    \item \textbf{JWT Token Management:} Generation and validation of access tokens (15-minute expiry) and refresh tokens with secure cookie storage (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
    \item \textbf{Token Blacklisting:} Redis-based blacklist for immediate token revocation on logout or security events.
    \item \textbf{Traditional Authentication:} Email/password authentication with bcrypt hashing.
    \item \textbf{Session Security:} CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and secure token lifecycle management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payment Portal with Stripe Integration}
This component handles monetization through Stripe, enabling tiered subscription plans with usage-based quotas.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stripe Checkout:} Hosted checkout session creation and payment processing.
    \item \textbf{Webhook Handling:} Secure webhook signature verification and idempotent event processing for payment lifecycle events.
    \item \textbf{Plan Management:} JSON-based plan configuration with versioning support and admin API.
    \item \textbf{Redis Caching:} Fast plan retrieval and Stripe price data caching with automatic cache invalidation.
    \item \textbf{Subscription Synchronization:} Real-time sync between Stripe and internal database for subscription status.
    \item \textbf{Quota Management:} Usage tracking and access control middleware enforcing plan limits.
    \item \textbf{Payment UI:} Plan comparison cards, checkout flow, and subscription management interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Frontend Dashboard}
This component provides a complete Single Page Application (SPA) using Vue.js 2 and Vuetify with Material Design.

\textbf{Key Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication UI:} Sign In, Sign Up pages with SSO integration and OAuth callback handling.
    \item \textbf{Protected Routing:} Vue Router with role-based navigation guards and lazy loading for performance.
    \item \textbf{State Management:} Vuex store for centralized state management (auth, user, subscription, plans).
    \item \textbf{HTTP Interceptors:} Automatic JWT token injection, token refresh logic, and retry mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{User Dashboard:} Subscription status display, usage quota tracking with progress indicators, profile management.
    \item \textbf{Admin Interface:} Plans management with JSON editor, validation, and version history.
    \item \textbf{Responsive Design:} Mobile and desktop layouts with Vuetify components and intuitive UX.
\end{itemize}
